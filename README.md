Thanks to the 3MF team and McNeel team for adding 3MF export options to the API (Rhino 8 only). 

V1 is our preferred option as it internalises the 3MF export option to always be False for 'Move output to positive XYZ octant'.

You can download the definition or also grab the User Objects directly. They will appear in the Params Tab.
